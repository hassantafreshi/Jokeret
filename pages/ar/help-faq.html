Napoleon or Nap created a new design for card games of 54 cards and 52 new games which could be played by these new cards when he was in jail.

                    From five hundred years ago, and in Iranian Plateau (mainly Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan west of the River Indus) people used to play card games which are named (ganjafeh)and after decays.
                    </p>
                    <h5> Cards: </h5>
                    <p>Card games include the Category club (♣) Diamond(♦) Spade(♠) Heart(♥️) and each category covering 13 cards from 2 to 10 and jack, queen, king, Ace. About 200 years before Americans created new forms of cards which had front and back side also americans made the glossy cards so they could play easier than before like paper cards.</p>
                        <h5> Symbols: </h5>
                        <p>A deck of cards includes 52 cards and each one has a Symbol. In card games, a deck of cards includes 12 face cards 40 numbers and 4 suit and each suit has 13 cards which are king, queen, jack, ace and 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2 and cards has 2 colors of black and red.Heart & Diamond are red and Spade & Club are black. The most interesting part is that 52 cards is a symbol of 52 weeks of the year, 4 suits are a symbol of the 4 seasons of a year. Diamond (♦) is symbol of moderate weather of spring , Club (♣) It is a symbol of hot summer, Heart (♥️) is symbol moderate weather of autumn (fall) and Spade (♠) is symbol of winter and cold weather. Also12 face cards is a symbol of 12 month of a year and 13 cards of a suit indicates that the moon rounds around earth 13 times a year. Each suit is a symbol of a season and contains 13 cards, from 1 to 10 and jack(11), queen(12), jack(13). If we sum these numbers we will have (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13)=91 that indicates days of a season.</p>

                                The Joker originated in the United States during the Civil War and was created as a Trump card for the game of Euchre. It has since been adopted into many other card games, where it often acts as a wild card, but may have other functions such as the top Trump, a skip card (forcing another player to miss a turn).
