              <div class="collapsible-body grey lighten-4"><span><p>A card game variation based on Persian origin, TRUMP(Hokm) is a trick-taking game popular in the middle east. The game uses a standard 52-card deck, and is played by 4 players in teams of 2. Teams sit crosswise.</p>
                <p>The dealer is known as the Trump-caller, and announces the Trump suit of their choosing. The Trump caller then leads the trick, and other players counter with larger valued cards of the same suit. The winner of each trick leads the next.</p>
                <p>Hokm is a team game and contains two teams and each team has two players, the king may choose Trump with the first 5 cards which are given. So each player must have 13 cards.</p>
                <p>In Hokm, each card has a value from ace, king, queen, jack, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two. Also Trumps value is higher than 3 other suits. for example if Trump is club, the two clubs value is higher than the ace of spades.</p>

Although some people think card games came from india. Because in the first card games there are used cane and cup and ring and Sword on cards design and there are several statues of cane and cup and ring and Sword around the country of india. Napoleon or Nap created a new design for card games of 54 cards and 52 new games which could be played by these new cards when he was in jail.

About 200 years before Americans created new forms of cards which had front and back side also americans made the glossy cards so they could play easier than before like paper cards.</p>
                        <h5> Symbols: </h5>
                        <p>A deck of cards includes 52 cards and each one has a Symbol. In card games, a deck of cards includes 12 face cards 40 numbers and 4 suit and each suit has 13 cards which are king, queen, jack, ace and 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2 and cards has 2 colors of black and red.Heart & Diamond are red and Spade & Club are black.

Diamond (♦) is symbol of moderate weather of spring , Club (♣) It is a symbol of hot summer, Heart (♥️) is symbol of moderate weather of autumn (fall) and Spade (♠) is symbol of winter and cold weather.

                                The Joker 🃏 originated in the United States during the Civil War and was created as a Trump card for the game of Euchre. It has since been adopted into many other card games, where it often acts as a wild card, but may have other functions such as the top Trump, a skip card (forcing another player to miss a turn).
